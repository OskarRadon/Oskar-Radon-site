        SpaceTime is my entry in the NASA Freelancer contest to design a smart watch application for use on the ISS. Although I didn't win the competition it was a great learning experience and my first foray into UI design.

        The problems with this design are easy to identify in retrospect, and comparing my design to the <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/contest/NASA-Challenge-Astronaut-Smartwatch-App-Interface-Design-261634-byentry-6597765.html">winning entry</a> is helpful in understanding its shortcomings. The main problem is that the interface is cluttered and interaction with it is unintuitive. It's not easy to tell what can be clicked/tapped on and what is a passive indicator, color should be constrained and used to bring attention to important data and instead it clutters the interface and confuses the user.

        One of my ideas in designing this was to have a cohesive experience on all three versions of the app (watch, tablet, desktop), but the entries that did well only focused on the watch. In trying to follow the prompt to the T, I ended up wasting my time to the detriment of my final design.
